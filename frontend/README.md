# CareFlow Frontend

React frontend for CareFlow, an EHR-style clinic workflow demo covering
scheduling, patient registration, facility administration, and document
management.

The app is built to feel like a compact clinical workspace: facility-scoped,
permission-aware, keyboard-friendly where practical, and organized around
front-desk and clinical workflows rather than raw database tables.

## Tech Stack

- React 19
- Vite
- React Router
- TanStack React Query
- Tailwind CSS v4 tokens
- Material UI date pickers
- React PDF/PDF.js for in-app document previews

## Product Areas

- Schedule workspace with agenda, day, multi-day, and resource-oriented views.
- Appointment creation/editing with patient search, drag/drop, context actions,
  activity log, configurable status/type colors, rooms, and resources.
- Patient workflows with Quick Start registration, smart search, inline Patient
  Hub registration editing, phone/SSN formatting, insurance, pharmacy, care
  team, and emergency contacts.
- Document Center with patient-scoped document lists, uploads, in-app PDF
  preview, download, category management, and bundled PDF export.
- Admin areas for organization profile, facilities, staff, roles/permissions,
  resources, appointment statuses/types, operating hours, document categories,
  and pharmacy preferences.
- User preferences for theme, schedule behavior, sidebar startup state,
  appointment block display, and persisted recent patients.

```

## Local Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The default local API base is `http://localhost:8000`; requests are versioned
under `/v1`. If the backend is elsewhere, create `frontend/.env.local`:

```bash
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
VITE_APP_URL=http://localhost:5173
VITE_DEMO_MODE=true
```

`VITE_API_URL` may include or omit `/v1`; the API client normalizes it.

## Scripts

```bash
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run preview
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix
npm run format:check
npm run format
```

For touched frontend source, prefer targeted lint while iterating. Before a
deploy or larger UI change, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

## API And Auth

- The frontend calls the Django backend through `src/shared/api/client.js`.
- API routes are automatically prefixed with `/v1`.
- Access tokens are kept in memory only.
- Refresh tokens are expected to live in an HTTP-only cookie set by the backend.
- Requests use `credentials: "include"` so refresh-cookie auth works across the
  deployed frontend/backend domains.
- Legacy local-storage auth tokens are cleared by the client.

Current auth endpoints include:

```text
/v1/users/token/
/v1/users/token/refresh/
/v1/users/logout/
/v1/users/me/
/v1/users/preferences/
```

## UI Notes

- Prefer shared primitives from `src/shared/components/ui/`.
- Prefer existing CareFlow tokens/classes from `src/index.css` over one-off
  colors.
- Keep clinical screens compact and calm; avoid extra subtitles, wrappers, and
  hidden overflow unless the component intentionally owns scrolling.
- For major UI work, inspect the changed flow in Chrome before finalizing.
- Dev-only visual experiments belong in `frontend/dev-previews/`, which is
  gitignored.

## Deployment

The production frontend is intended for Vercel. Typical settings:

```text
Root Directory: frontend
Build Command: npm run build
Output Directory: dist
```

Set `VITE_API_URL` to the deployed backend base URL, for example:

```bash
VITE_API_URL=https://api.careflow.xinyiklin.com
VITE_APP_URL=https://careflow.xinyiklin.com
VITE_DEMO_MODE=true
```

The backend must allow the frontend origin in CORS and CSRF settings.

## Safety

CareFlow uses synthetic demo data only. Do not enter real patient data, PHI,
tokens, or secrets into local or demo environments.
